Whether you are a brand, solution integrator, retailer, manufacturer the question remains the same how to &#39;get smart&#39; and fast.

**Why?**

The industry (IoT &amp; AI) is booming and developing so fast as many people are incorporation smart devices in their homes now due to the introduction of smart speakers by Amazon Alexa, Google Home &amp; Apple Homekit the process has become significantly faster. Their smart speakers brand awareness programs &amp; lack of products to be integrated with them creates a gap.

This means its time start slapping your label on the smart lighting products now.

But this task can be a difficult one. As you don&#39;t know which manufacturer, supplier to deal with, which technology to choose, which products to choose, when they will be ready to market, how to take it into the market &amp; at the doorstep of your consumer or even what is IoT &amp; AI.

That&#39;s okay. We have got you covered.

**Here are the three ways to quick start your smart journey.**

**1. Focus on what you do best**

What is your brand know for? What people love about your brand? What are your strengths, it is manufacturing? it is integration?

Take those products and make them smart.

If you&#39;re a lighting expert you couldn&#39;t pick the best time in history to begin converting your products to smart. You should get used to in believing that your customers would be willing to control the devices through their smartphone at any point based on the time of day or who is home.

Remember this if you are not going to do it then your competition will and when it happens the word of mouth spreads fast-and you have already lost the first mover advantage. You will be LATE.

**2. Find someone whom has connections**

Assuming as you don&#39;t have connections for the manufacturers and suppliers of the smart lighting products you will have to find someone who does. This company should know the in and out of the smart lighting market &amp; go-to market products from hardware to software to their customisation to testing &amp; lastly mass production and most importantly connecting them with brands &amp; retailers.

**You will ask if you can build your own smart lighting products?**

Yes, you can. But this would incur you with serious cost, headache, pain and most importantly time which you can utilize on your Go-to Market products and hit the revenues.

Partnering up with an IoT ecosystem provider would be significantly cheaper and time saving towards starting your empire.

**3. Make sure the solution provider can do everything and provide great support**

IoT is about three things- 1.Connectivity that will be Wi-Fi, 2.Application that comes in different shapes, sizes &amp; functionality. 3. Cloud Connectivity which helps in communicating smart devices with each other.

You don&#39;t want to go one company manufacturer relations and second for connectivity and the third for application. Long meetings. It will be a nightmare.

**Conclusion**

You want a single expert for all your needs. One which has deep connection with the manufacturers &amp; suppliers, know about the connectivity protocols and about cloud connectivity and most importantly the one which can provide great support in the every of step of your business journey.

Now that&#39;s the partner you want.
