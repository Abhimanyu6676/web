        FAQ: My home Wi-Fi doesn’t appear in the list?
      </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Make sure you are connecting with 2.4Ghz bandwidth network. Huelite lights connect to the 2.4Ghz band of Wi-Fi not 5Ghz. If you have more than one available network on your router this could mean you are connected to 5Ghz and need to try your other network. All Wi-Fi routers have a 2.4 GHz band so if you only have one network you will be on the right one to get started.
          </p>

            Try refreshing the network list with the `Refresh Wifi Scan` button on the screen.
