- #### Set the device in ON state

- #### Now switch the light off and on 5 times (in an interval of 3-4 seconds, not too fast). then leave the device in ON state.

- Device should now restart in next 10-15 seconds(depending upon your model)

- Blinking of light strip will indicate a successful reset.(only applicable in HUElite Aurora Strip Lights)
