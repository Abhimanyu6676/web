## custom bootstrap

bootstrap with '\_' naming convention as compared to '-' naming convention of bootstrap default.

## why custom bootstrap

bootstrap is amazing but it lack **position/alignment for media queries** `upward breakpoints` `downward breakpoints` `enclosed breakpoints`. when your wen=bsite grows you end up writing same alignment media queries so many time. instead we use sass function to generate position/alignment classes for each breakpont condition using bootstrap **media-breakpoint-\*\***
